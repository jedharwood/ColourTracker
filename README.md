# ColourTracker
.Net Core CRUD app with React front end
I'm creating this app to try and showcase how far my development skills have progressed since I started working as a Junior Developer in August 2019. I'm beginning with an MVC app that can display and manage a collection of colours through a ReactJs front end. I'll initially be wiring my storage handler to read from and write to a local text file while I get the Add method working from the front end. Once this is in place I will be moving the storage out to Azure Blob storage or MongoDb or something. After this functionality is in place I will look to style the front end with Less/CSS, sort out the MVC Layouts and add in ReactRouter and a host of other planned improvements.
Feedback encouraged and welcomed.
