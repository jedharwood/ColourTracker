# ColourTracker
.Net Core CRUD app with React front end.
I'm creating this app to try and showcase how far my development skills have progressed since I started working as a Junior Developer in August 2019. This project started out as an MVC app that can display and manage a collection of colours through a ReactJs.Net front end. I am now in the process of replacing the .jsx file in the .net core project with a standalone react front end. 
I've initially wired my storage handler to read from and write to a json file in the solution while I hook up the React App. Once this is working I will be moving the storage out to Azure Blob storage or MongoDb or something. 
I will look to style the front end with Bootstrap + CSS/Less.
Next stages;
Hook-up react app to .net core project,
Replace Fetch with Axios in create-rect-app,
Implement REST functions,
Style front end with Sass,
Exception handling in .net core project,
Feedback encouraged and welcomed.
